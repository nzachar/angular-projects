    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age; //For primitives values are copied, 
    // so if you change the original one, it won't update the second one
    console.log(age, age2);

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    }, 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const teams = players;
    console.log(players, teams);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    teams[3] = 'lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //--both will be updated with lux, since they are both reference to the original array

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const newArrayWithSlice = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const newArrayWithConcat = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const newArrayWithSpread = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter: 'test',
        facebook: 'facebook'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // For object literals (new in ECMAScript 2018):
    const person3 = { ...person, age: 95 };

 //only shallow copy!! so only one level deep is copied the rest is just a reference!!!
 // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
//spread is also good for contactenation of arrays.
